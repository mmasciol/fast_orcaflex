      CASE ( 3 )                 ! Wheeler stretching.


      ! Wheeler stretching says that wave kinematics calculated using Airy theory
      !   at the mean sea level should actually be applied at the instantaneous
      !   free surface and that Airy wave kinematics computed at locations between
      !   the seabed and the mean sea level should be shifted vertically to new
      !   locations in proportion to their elevation above the seabed.
      !
      ! Thus, given a range of zi(:) where we want to know the wave kinematics
      !   after applying Wheeler stretching, the required range of ziPrime(:)
      !   where the wave kinematics need to be computed before applying
      !   stretching, is as follows:
      !
      ! ziPrime_Min <= ziPrime(:) <= ziPrime_Max
      !
      ! ziPrime_Min = MAX{ ( zi_Min - WaveElev_Max )/( 1 + WaveElev_Max/WtrDpth ), -WtrDpth }
      ! ziPrime_Max = MIN{ ( zi_Max - WaveElev_Min )/( 1 + WaveElev_Min/WtrDpth ),        0 }
      !
      ! where,
      !   zi_Max        = maximum elevation where the wave kinematics are to be
      !                   applied using stretching to the instantaneous free
      !                   surface
      !   zi_Min        = minimum elevation where the wave kinematics are to be
      !                   applied using stretching to the instantaneous free
      !                   surface
      !   ziPrime_Max   = maximum elevation where the wave kinematics are computed
      !                   before applying stretching to the instantaneous free
      !                   surface
      !   ziPrime_Min   = minimum elevation where the wave kinematics are computed
      !                   before applying stretching to the instantaneous free
      !                   surface
      !   WaveElev_Max  = maximum expected value of the instantaneous elevation of
      !                   incident waves
      !   WaveElev_Min  = minimum expected value of the instantaneous elevation of
      !                   incident waves
      !

      !   kinematics at each of the NWaveKin0 points along a vertical line passing
      !   through the platform reference point [defined by the zi-coordinates

      FUNCTION WheelerStretching ( zOrzPrime, Zeta, h, ForwardOrBackward )


         ! This FUNCTION applies the principle of Wheeler stretching to
         ! (1-Forward) find the elevation where the wave kinematics are to
         ! be applied using Wheeler stretching or (2-Backword) find the
         ! elevation where the wave kinematics are computed before applying
         ! Wheeler stretching.  Wheeler stretching says that wave
         ! kinematics calculated using Airy theory at the mean sea level
         ! should actually be applied at the instantaneous free surface and
         ! that Airy wave kinematics computed at locations between the
         ! seabed and the mean sea level should be shifted vertically to
         ! new locations in proportion to their elevation above the seabed
         ! as follows:
         !
         ! Forward:  z(zPrime,Zeta,h) = ( 1 + Zeta/h )*zPrime + Zeta
         !
         ! or equivalently:
         !
         ! Backword: zPrime(z,Zeta,h) = ( z - Zeta )/( 1 + Zeta/h )
         !
         ! where,
         !   Zeta   = instantaneous elevation of incident waves

   SUBROUTINE FltngPtfmLd ( X, XD, ZTime, PtfmAM, PtfmFt )


      ! This routine implements the time domain hydrodynamic loading and
      ! mooring system dynamics equations for the floating platform.  The
      ! loads from the mooring system are obtained through an interface
      ! with the LINES module of SML and include contributions from
      ! inertia, restoring, and viscous separation damping effects,
      ! including the elastic response of multi-segment lines and their
      ! interaction with the seabed.  The hydrodynamic loads on the support
      ! platform include the restoring contributions of buoyancy and
      ! waterplane area from hydrostatics; the viscous drag contributions
      ! from Morison's equation; the added mass and damping contributions
      ! from radiation, including free surface memory effects; and the
      ! incident wave excitation from diffraction in regular or irregular
      ! seas.  The diffraction, radiation, and hydrostatics problems are
      ! implemented in their true linear form.  Not included in the model
      ! are the effects of vortex-induced vibration and loading from sea
      ! ice, as well as the nonlinear effects of slow-drift and sum-
      ! frequency excitation and high-order wave kinematics.

      ! The order of indices in all arrays passed to and from this routine
      !   is as follows:
      !      1 = Platform surge / xi-component of platform translation (internal DOF index = DOF_Sg)
      !      3 = Platform sway  / yi-component of platform translation (internal DOF index = DOF_Sw)
      !      3 = Platform heave / zi-component of platform translation (internal DOF index = DOF_Hv)
      !      4 = Platform roll  / xi-component of platform rotation    (internal DOF index = DOF_R )
      !      5 = Platform pitch / yi-component of platform rotation    (internal DOF index = DOF_P )
      !      6 = Platform yaw   / zi-component of platform rotation    (internal DOF index = DOF_Y )

      ! NOTE: In extreme wave conditions (i.e., hurricane sea states,
      !       etc.), radiation damping will not be important but Morison's
      !       equation with stretching is very important.  Therefore, these
      !       hydrodynamic loading equations, which are in true linear
      !       form, are limited in their accuracy in such sea conditions.

         ! This is a dummy routine for holding the place of a user-specified
         ! mooring system.  Modify this code to create your own model of an
         ! array of mooring lines.  The local variables and associated
         ! calculations below provide a template for making this
         ! user-specified mooring system model include a linear 6x6 restoring
         ! matrix with offset.  These are provided as an example only and can
         ! be modified or deleted as desired by the user without detriment to
         ! the interface (i.e., they are not necessary for the interface).

         ! The primary output of this routine is array F(:), which must
         ! contain the 3 components of the total force from all mooring lines
         ! (in N) acting at the platform reference and the 3 components of the
         ! total moment from all mooring lines (in N-m) acting at the platform
         ! reference; positive forces are in the direction of positive
         ! platform displacement.  This primary output effects the overall
         ! dynamic response of the system.  However, this routine must also
         ! compute:
         !   Array FairHTen(:)   - Effective horizontal tension at the fairlead of each mooring line
         !   Array FairVTen(:)   - Effective vertical   tension at the fairlead of each mooring line
         !   Array AnchHTen(:)   - Effective horizontal tension at the anchor   of each mooring line
         !   Array AnchVTen(:)   - Effective vertical   tension at the anchor   of each mooring line
         !   Array NodesTen(:,:) - Effective line tensions              at each node of each line
         !   Array Nodesxi (:,:) - xi-coordinates in the inertial frame of each node of each line
         !   Array Nodesyi (:,:) - yi-coordinates in the inertial frame of each node of each line
         !   Array Nodeszi (:,:) - zi-coordinates in the inertial frame of each node of each line
         ! These secondary outputs are only used to determine what to output
         ! for the associated parameters placed in the OutList from the
         ! primary input file.  The number of mooring lines where the fairlead
         ! and anchor tensions can be output and the number of nodes per line
         ! where the mooring line position and tension can be output, NumLines
         ! and LineNodes, respectively, are additional inputs to this routine.

!JASON: MOVE THIS USER-DEFINED ROUTINE (UserTwrLd) TO THE UserSubs.f90 OF FAST WHEN THE MONOPILE LOADING FUNCTIONALITY HAS BEEN DOCUMENTED!!!!!
SUBROUTINE UserTwrLd ( JNode, X, XD, ZTime, DirRoot, TwrAM, TwrFt )


   ! This is a dummy routine for holding the place of a user-specified
   ! tower loading model.  Modify this code to create your own model.
   ! The local variables and associated calculations below provide a
   ! template for making this user-specified tower loading model
   ! include linear 6x6 damping and stiffness matrices.  These are
   ! provided as an example only and can be modified or deleted as
   ! desired by the user without detriment to the interface (i.e., they
   ! are not necessary for the interface).

   ! The tower loads returned by this routine should contain contributions from
   !   any external load acting on the current tower element (indicated by
   !   JNode) other than loads transmitted from tower aerodynamics.  For
   !   example, these tower forces should contain contributions from foundation
   !   stiffness and damping [not floating] or mooring line/guy wire restoring
   !   and damping, as well as hydrostatic and hydrodynamic contributions
   !   [offshore].

   ! This routine assumes that the tower loads are transmitted through a medium
   !   like soil [foundation] and/or water [offshore], so that added mass
   !   effects are important.  Consequently, the routine assumes that the total
   !   load per unit length on the current tower element can be written as:
   !
   ! TwrF(i) = SUM( -TwrAM(i,j)*XDD(j), j=1,2,..,6) + TwrFt(i) for i=1,2,...,6
   !
   ! where,
   !   TwrF(i)    = the i'th component of the total load per unit length
   !                applied on the current tower element; positive in the
   !                direction of positive motion of the i'th DOF of the current
   !                tower element
   !   TwrAM(i,j) = the (i,j) component of the tower added mass matrix per unit
   !                length (output by this routine)
   !   XDD(j)     = the j'th component of the current tower element
   !                acceleration vector
   !   TwrFt(i)   = the i'th component of the portion of the current tower
   !                element load per unit length associated with everything but
   !                the added mass effects; positive in the direction of
   !                positive motion of the i'th DOF of the current tower
   !                element (output by this routine)

   ! The order of indices in all arrays passed to and from this routine is as
   !   follows:
   !      1 = Current tower element surge / xi-component of translation
   !      3 = Current tower element sway  / yi-component of translation
   !      3 = Current tower element heave / zi-component of translation
   !      4 = Current tower element roll  / xi-component of rotation
   !      5 = Current tower element pitch / yi-component of rotation
   !      6 = Current tower element yaw   / zi-component of rotation

   ! NOTE: The added mass matrix returned by this routine, TwrAM, must be
   !       symmetric.  FAST and ADAMS will abort otherwise.
   !
   !       Please also note that the hydrostatic restoring contribution to the
   !       hydrodynamic force returned by this routine should not contain the
   !       effects of body weight, as is often done in classical marine
   !       hydrodynamics.  The effects of body weight are included within FAST
   !       and ADAMS.
