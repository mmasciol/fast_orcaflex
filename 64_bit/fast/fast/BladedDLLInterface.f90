   ! NOTE: This source file contains example PitchCntrl(), UserHSSBr(),
   !       UserVSCont(), and UserYawCont() routines that are used to interface
   !       FAST with a master controller implemented as a dynamic-link-library
   !       (DLL) in the style of Garrad Hassan's Bladed wind turbine software
   !       package.  All four routines call routine BladedDLLInterface(), which
   !       contains a call to the Bladed-style DLL that evaluates as DISCON().
   !       Routine BladedDLLInterface() USEs a MODULE named
   !       BladedDLLParameters(), which stores values of PARAMETER constants
   !       used in the interface.

   !       This source file is useful if you have a DLL controller created for
   !       a Bladed model and you want to use the same controller for your FAST
   !       model.  This source file is also a useful template if you prefer to
   !       control pitch, HSS brake torque, generator torque, and yaw with a
   !       single master controller, regardless of whether or not you use the
   !       Bladed code and regardless of whether or not you want to work with
   !       DLLs.

   !       In order to use these routines, you must first set the values of the
   !       PARAMETERs contained in MODULE BladedDLLParameters() as required by
   !       your model.  These PARAMETERs are model-specific inputs available in
   !       the Bladed code, which are not available inputs in FAST, and are
   !       passed to the Bladed DLL in this interface.  You must then
   !       comment-out the dummy placeholder versions of routines PitchCntrl(),
   !       UserHSSBr(), UserVSCont(), and UserYawCont() contained in source
   !       file UserSubs.f90 and recompile FAST with this additional source
   !       file.  The executable version of FAST that is distributed with the
   !       FAST archive is NOT linked with the routines contained within this
   !       source file.  Once FAST has been compiled with these routines, in
   !       order to use them in your simulation, the following inputs from the
   !       primary input file should be set accordingly (these conditions are
   !       NOT tested by these example routines):
   !          YCMode    = 1    - tells FAST to use routine UserYawCont() for active yaw control
   !          TYCOn     = 0.0  - tells FAST to start active yaw control at the beginning of the simulation
   !          PCMode    = 1    - tells FAST to use routine PitchCntrl() for active pitch control
   !          TPCOn     = 0.0  - tells FAST to start active pitch control at the beginning of the simulation
   !          VSContrl  = 2    - tells FAST to use routine UserVSCont() for active variable-speed torque control
   !          GenTiStr  = True - tells FAST to start torque control based on time TimGenOn
   !          GenTiStp  = True - tells FAST to stop  torque control based on time TimGenOf
   !          TimGenOn  = 0.0  - tells FAST to start torque control at the beginning of the simulation
   !          TimGenOf  > TMax - tells FAST not to stop controlling torque throughout the simulation
   !          HSSBrMode = 2    - tells FAST to use routine UserHSSBr() for control of the HSS brake
   !          THSSBrDp  = 0.0  - tells FAST to start HSS brake torque control at the beginning of the simulation

   !       This interface is valid for DLLs of the style specified in
   !       Appendices A and B of the Bladed User Manual of Bladed version 3.6.
   !       If you are running FAST using a master controller DLL developed in
   !       Bladed, please be aware of the following differences between this
   !       interface and Bladed's interface:
   !          Record  1, the status flag, is NOT set to -1 for the final call at the end of the simulation
   !          Record 10, the pitch actuator type, is always set to 0 by FAST indicating pitch position actuator; as such, the returned value of Record 46, demanded pitch rate (Collective pitch), is always ignored
   !          Record 29, the yaw control type, is always set to 0 by FAST indicating yaw rate control; as such, the returned value of Record 41, demanded yaw actuator torque, is always ignored
   !          Record 35, the generator contactor status, is initialized to 1 by FAST indicating main (high speed) or variable speed generator; the generator can be turned off in the DLL by setting Record 35 to 0 or by setting Record 47 to 0.0; if the DLL redefines Record 35 to something other than 0 or 1 (such as 2 = low speed generator), the program will Abort
   !          Record 41, the demanded yaw actuator torque, is always ignored in accordance with the specification of Record 29
   !          Record 46, the demanded pitch rate (Collective pitch), is always ignored in accordance with the specification of Record 10
   !          Record 55, the pitch  override returned by the DLL, must be set to 0 by the DLL indicating no override (i.e., pitch  demands come for the DLL); the program will Abort otherwise
   !          Record 56, the torque override returned by the DLL, must be set to 0 by the DLL indicating no override (i.e., torque demands come for the DLL); the program will Abort otherwise
   !          Record 62, the max. number of values which can be returned for logging, is always set to 0 by FAST indicating none
   !          Record 63, the record number for start of logging output, is always set to 0 (a don't care) by FAST in accordance with the specification of Record 62
   !          Record 64, the max. number of characters which can be returned in "OUTNAME", is always set to 0 in accordance with the specification of Record 62
   !          Record 65, the number of variables returned for logging returned by the DLL, must be set to 0 by the DLL indicating none in accordance with the specification of Record 62; the program will Abort otherwise
   !          Record 72, the generator start-up resistance, is always ignored
   !          Record 79, the request for loads, is ignored; instead, the blade, hub, and yaw bearing loads are always passed to the DLL as if Record 79 was set to 4
   !          Record 80, the variable-slip current demand toggle switch, is always ignored; instead, the generator torque demand from Record 47 is always used
   !          Record 81, the variable-slip current demand, is always ignored in accordance with the handling of Record 80
